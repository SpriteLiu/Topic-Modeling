# Topic-Modeling

Introduction: What does the project mainly focus on?
The goal of the project is to conduct a text analysis based on the IMDB dataset containing 50k movie reviews. The dataset contains binary sentiment classifications of a large quantity of movie reviews. Our main goal is to figure out the topics.

Usage : Why is this project useful?
The original dataset contains too much information, most of which is useless. By processing this analysis, we make the data more tidy and concentrated so that we could focus more on the topics but not the attitudes of the reviewers.
